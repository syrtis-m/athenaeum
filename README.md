# Athenaeum

A visual novel set in an infinite library.

You grew up in a small community in the SPECULATIVE FICTION: AGRICULTURE section. 
Now that you're an adult, you must decide to either stay in your community or leave to explore the rest of the library. 
Hear the story of those who chose to stay and those who left before deciding to stay or leave.

Athenaeum has four possible endings and a playtime of roughly 20 minutes.
